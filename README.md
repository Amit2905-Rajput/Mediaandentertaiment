This code uses AI to analyze YouTube comments for positive, negative, or neutral opinions. Clean the text by removing irrelevant words, symbols and links; this allows for an easier interpretation of text by the computer. The text is then translated into numerical data through a technique called TF-IDF vectorization, which provides a clear way for the machine learning model to recognize which words are important. A Logistic Regression model is developed to extract significant patterns from those comments in order to help predict the comment sentiment. Its accuracy equated to 76%-which means that the model was able to classify most comments correctly. Finally, this will be helpful for new comment sentiment predictions enabling media platforms to understand audience opinion and improve their content strategy. The model is a fine approach for social media, online review, and customer feedback analyzes.
